#### General

`PigExplode` is a small project to experiment with the `UIKitDynamics` API.

The goal is to understand some of the underlying mechanics of `UIKitDynamics` and learn how to use the API properly.

If you want to read more about how I created the project and my learnings, check out my [blog post](https://github.com/nikolasburk/PigExplode/blob/master/article.md).
